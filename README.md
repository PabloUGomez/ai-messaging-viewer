Front End Intern Examination Project
Overview

We are building an AI messaging platform and need to assess your ability to create intuitive, performant interfaces for displaying message histories. This assessment will evaluate your skills in React, UI/UX design, and frontend development best practices.

Task

Create a message viewer interface that displays conversation histories between users and AI. The data will be provided via a REST GET endpoint http://www.backup-backend.readychatai.com/messages_json. Your implementation should focus on both functionality and visual design.

Core Requirements

Message Display & Organization

Group messages by date (Today, Yesterday, This Week, and earlier dates)

Display messages with clear visual distinction between AI and user messages

Show timestamps in an easily readable format

Implement proper message threading and conversation flow

UI/UX Requirements

Create a responsive design that works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop views

Add a "jump to bottom" button when scrolling through history

Create sticky date headers that remain visible while scrolling through message groups

Technical Requirements

Use React with TypeScript

Implement proper loading states and error handling

Ensure smooth scrolling and transitions between message groups

Bonus Features (Optional)

Keyboard navigation between messages

Message search functionality

Message selection with copy functionality

Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
